💫Hi! I'm Yassine, a software engineer in the making.

🌎I've been interested in code for as long as I can remember. I started with HTML and CSS, then moved on to Python and now C. I'm always learning new things, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

💡 I'm passionate about using code to solve problems and make the world a better place. I'm also interested in data science, and I'm excited to see how I can use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.

🔸You can find me on Instagram at @yassine_elmes and on Discord at falvius.

🏛I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

✨Thanks for reading!
